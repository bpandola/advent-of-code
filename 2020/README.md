## Day 1: Report Repair

Oh, man, just by sheer luck I had my input parser already set up for a list 
of numbers and I had the answer in under a minute, but... the site went down!
Well, that's a bummer.  I had the right solution on the first try for both 
parts, so I had that going for me, which is nice. (Yes, I realize this was a 
dead simple Day 1 puzzle, but I gotta get my wins where I can.)

When I finally managed to get back on to the site, I came in around rank 1000
for both parts, although the AoC author later nullified the Day 1 leaderboard 
for obvious reasons.

I know how fast the people on the leaderboard can go and I'm realizing that
even just picking my variables names as `puzzle_input` instead of `p` or 
whatever does matter.  I probably don't have a real shot at getting in the 
Top 100 for any day, but my plan is to do a first pass just to complete the
puzzle, then do a "cleaned up" version, and finally (if it makes sense) I'll
do a "generalized" solution.
