# Advent of Code 2022

I was going to practice before this year's puzzles, but of course I didn't.

I was on vacation for the first x days, so I caught up on those first without
the time pressure, which was nice.

The first day I did live was Day y.

## Day 1: Calorie Counting

Straightforward Day 1, as usual.  I had to kinda get my mind back into thinking 
about parsing inputs again...  I used `max` for Part 1, but then tweaked things
a bit for Part 2 using a sorted array (that worked for both parts).   One minor
mistake in forgetting to use `reverse=True` for the sort, but I did my standard
test asserts before printing my answer, so I caught that before submitting.
Got both parts right on the first try, and hoping to keep that up for as long as 
possible this year!
