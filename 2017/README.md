# Advent of Code 2017

## Day 1: Inverse Captcha

Simple and straightforward.  Managed to come up with a generalized solver for 
both parts.

## Day 2: Corruption Checksum

My answer on Part 1 looked wrong and I managed to figure out that I had my 
min/max initial values swapped.  Fixed that and submitted the correct answer
on the first try.  Part 2 I stupidly used combination instead of permutation.
Once fixed, answer was correct.
